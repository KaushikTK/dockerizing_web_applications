# MERN STACK

To build and run, do:
`docker compose up`

* The client is running on port 3000
* The express server is running on port 4000
* The mongodb server is running on port 27017

Api calls could be made to the express server through 'http://localhost:4000/'

To connect to the mongodb, use the name of the container, i.e., 'mongo' in the url instead of localhost.

All the data in the database is saved to data folder for persistent storage.
